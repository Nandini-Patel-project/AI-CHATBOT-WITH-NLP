This project implements a simple AI-powered chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the help of the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library and a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

**Features:**

Basic Conversational Chatbot: The chatbot can respond to basic user queries such as "Hi," "What can you do?", and "What is your name?". It can also handle more dynamic inputs with pre-defined patterns and responses.
Pattern Matching: The chatbot uses regular expressions to match the user's input with predefined patterns. If no suitable response is found, it returns a default response.
Interactive GUI: The chatbot is integrated with a simple Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to interact with the chatbot in a window, where they can send messages and view responses.
Customizable Responses: You can easily add or modify response patterns to suit different use cases.

**Code Walkthrough:**

NLTK Setup: The project uses nltk.chat.util.Chat and reflections for conversational flow.
GUI Design: Tkinter is used to create the GUI with a scrollable text area for displaying the conversation.
User Interaction: The user types messages in a text input field, and the chatbot responds. If the user types "quit," the conversation ends.

**Files:**

chatbot.py: The main Python file containing the logic for the chatbot, pattern matching, and GUI.
settings.json: Configuration file to adjust settings like Git ignore warnings.
